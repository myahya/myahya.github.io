# What is Question Answering?

Question answering is a core information retrieval and [natural language processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf) task that has been with us for as long as computers existed. But what distinguishes question answering from the search setting we are familiar with, where we input keywords and expect a ranked list of relevant documents (i.e. [ad hoc retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf#page=42))?

## Setting

* **User**: the human who has an information need they want satisfied.
* **Information need**: the topic the user wants to learn about.  
  ```
  I'm giving a talk about question answering. I want to know when IBM Watson won the game show Jeopardy!
  ```
* **Question**: the user casts the information need into a question that can be answered by the QA system.
  ```
  When did IBM Watson win Jeopardy?
  ```

* **Question answering system**: it takes a question and gives back answers.

* **Answer**: we'll discuss what makes an answer a good one below.
  ```
  What happened: On *Feb. 16, 2011*, the final episode aired featuring IBM's Watson going up against top champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.

  It wasn't even a contest — by the end of the third and concluding match, Watson was up nearly $50,000.

# Questions
`When did IBM Watson win Jeopardy?` is clearly a question. It is a [well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formedness) [interrogative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative) English sentence. If you ask it to a human, they'll know exactly what you mean[^1].

What about something like `IBM Watson Jeopardy win date`. This query is neither a well-formed English sentence nor an interrogative one. Technically, it is not a question, but it does have a *question intent: the user posing the query is expecting an answer* like the example one above. We refer queries with a question intent that are not well-formed sentences to these as *[telegraphic queries](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1117/)*. This naming comes from how [telegrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_style) (messages sent using telegraphs) are formulated:

> The telegraph companies charged for their service by the number of words in a message, with a maximum of 15 characters per word for a plain-language telegram, and 10 per word for one written in code. The style developed to minimize costs but still convey the message clearly and unambiguously.
> 
> ― https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_style

Based on the above, in the context of question answering, when we say "question", we don't always mean a well-formed question. Instead, we could be referring to queries with a question intent that are in need of an answer.

There is an interpretation of all of the following queries where they have a question intent:

* `Who is the prime minister of the UK?`
  
  This is a well-formed question, so it is clear it has a question intent.

* `who is the prime minister of the uk?`

  This is an all-lowercase query. Strictly, this is not correct English due to improper casing. The lack of proper casing might make it difficult for a question answering system to deal with this query if, for example, the QA system relies on a [named entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) and [disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) system to determine that `"uk"` maps to https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q145.
  
* `who is the prime minister of the uk`
   
   The same as the previous question, but without a question mark.
 
* `who is uk prime minister`
  
  We still have a wh-work (who) in the above question, but it is gramatically incorrect, lacks casing, and does not end with a question mark.

* `uk prime minister`

  Here, one can debate whether this is a question -- is someone issuing this to a search engine asking `Who is the prime minister of the UK?`? Maybe they just want to browse the last news about the British PM, or maybe they want to navigate to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom to discover more about the role.


* `pm`

  This is an extreme but not unrealistic version of the above and all the considerations there apply here. Moreover, whether this query has a question intent depends on the user, their search session, and the state of the world: are they querying from a country that has a prime minister? are they from a country that has a prime minister? were the PM election results just announced? ...

  Of course, the person asking it could also be interested in knowing something about the [concept of a prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister), "post meridiem" (in the 12-hour clock), The BBC program [PM](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qskw), or anyone of the meanings you can see by going to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM (assuming it is meant as a English query in the first place, and [not](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM) [in](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pm) [a](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM) [different](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM) [language](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM)).

  To summarize, `pm` can actually be considered a question or a query with question intent with the meaning `Who is the prime minister?`.


## Answers

We defined a question, or a query with a question intent as one that is looking for answers, but what is an answer?

Here it is instructive to go back to the opening paragraph of this article and contrast question answering with ad hoc retrieval. In ad hoc retrieval, the user submits a query to the search system and in return gets a ranked list of documents relevant to the query -- most of us experience this in the form of "ten blue links"

### Can There be Multiple Answers?
This is a UX problem. If you're delivering answers through a screen, then the answer is probably 'yes'. If you're delivering answers by voice (possibly to someone driving a car o)

[^1]: OK, maybe not everyone will know what IBM Watson and Jeopardy are, but a human with exposure to these concepts would know what you mean.
