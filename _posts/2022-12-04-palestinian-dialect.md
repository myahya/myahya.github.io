# Palestinian Terms

## Context
I am Palestinian. Both of my parents come from the Palestinian villiage of [Innaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innaba) (عنَابة), which means I also come from Innaba. Growing up, I was exposed to my grandparents on both sides speaking the dialect of Innaba, which is a [rural Palestinian dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Arabic#Rural_varieties). The goal here is to document words and phrases that I grew up hearing and, for some, saying.
